Making my SVG little pony (unicorn) dance.

My task is make an easter egg, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)#Software). When a visitor presses the 'u' key on their keyboard an image of a unicorn should dance across the screen from left to right. Use your favorite unicorn image (from the internet, donâ€™t send us the unicorn image), and make sure you clean up the DOM after unicorn has left the screen.

### Goals
- [ ] Re-path the SVG I created in Illustrator so her legs are individual <path> elements. Currently, the entire body contains 2 of the legs also, so it isn't easy to move them.
- [ ] Write some CSS on each legs that transitions her legs into a galloping position.
- [ ] Write this all in JS functions that you can paste into console, that makes her dance across the screen.
- [ ] Write a binding to the U key
- [ ] Test it out.
